How to configure Firefox

    Open Firefox
    In the address bar type: about:config
    Firefox3.x and later requires you to agree that you will proceed with caution.
    After the config page loads, in the filter box type: network.automatic
    * Modify network.automatic-ntlm-auth.trusted-uris by double clicking the row and enter http://www.replacewithyoursite.com or http://your-intranet-server-name
    * Multiple sites can be added by comma delimiting them such as http://www.replacewithyoursite.com, http://www.replacewithyourintranetsite.com
